SMPP implementation in NodeJS
==============================

An attempt to implement SMPP protocol client within NodeJS. Since this project
is not a hobby, it definitely will be finished at some point.

Reasoning behind writing my own version is as follows:

* Assess, and improve my knowledge of JavaScript and NodeJS in particular.
* Provide my project with fast
* Finally rewrite my old SMPP daemon, which (don't laugh) is written in
PHP and works just well, but lacks some of the features.

Also - this is not clone, or fork of [shorty](https://github.com/mtd/shorty),
which obviously is first ever SMPP library for NodeJS.
